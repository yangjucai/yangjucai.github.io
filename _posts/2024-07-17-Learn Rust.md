# Introduction

### The big difference between C/C++ and Rust: 
> *safe by default*:<br> all memory accesses are checked.

### The unifying principles behind Rust:
> * strictly enforcing safe *borrowing* of data
> * functions, methods and closures to operate on data
> * tuples, structs and enums to aggerate data
> * pattern matching to select and destructre data
> * traits to define *behaviour* on data

### Rust is statically-typed and strongly-typed
> static types: <br>
> the type is known at compile time <br>
>
> dynamic types: <br>
> the type is known at run time
